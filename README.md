Once you run the code, the program will ask the user if they would like to go first or if they would like the computer to go first. Once an option is inputted, it will ask the user how long the computer should think (in seconds). The game will then continue, prompting the user for thier next move and recording the moves of both the user and the computer. Once there is a winner, it will ask the user if they would like to play again or exit if not.
